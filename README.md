# Cloud Architect Portfolio

Hands-on labs showcasing Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and DevOps automation.
Each folder contains minimal, production-style examples with READMEs to run locally or in a sandbox account.

## Contents
- `azure-aks-terraform/` — Terraform IaC for Azure VNet + AKS, plus sample k8s app.
- `aws-vpc-asg/` — Terraform IaC for AWS VPC + ALB + Auto Scaling Group.
- `ci-cd-pipeline-demo/` — Simple app + GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
- `kubernetes-helm-demo/` — Manifests + a minimal Helm chart for a web app.
- `cloud-security-policies/` — AWS IAM least-privilege examples and Azure RBAC role assignment samples.

> NOTE: These examples are intentionally minimal so reviewers can scan quickly.
